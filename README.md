* gurobi installation: contains manual on how to correctly install gurobi 
* project description: contains all important project information
* problem formulation: contains the mathematical formulation of the scheduling problem (MILP) and input description

#### Instances
Contains a set of test instances 

#### Classes
Use this folder to save your classes
* milp: contains the gurobi implementation of the MILP of the given formulation. 

#### Classes
Use this folder to save your functions

#### Solve instances 
To run the MILP, main.py can be used. Additional code is required for performance analysis. Currently, no time limit is set to the solver.
